            <header class="headings">What method to use in finding a song?</header>
            <p class="describe">there multiple method for one to find a song you like but here is some that you could try.</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
              <fieldset class="method">
                <legend class="method-heading">Youtube search</legend>
                <p>Youtube contain variety of song with different language and type so it is one of the best place to find a music, in which you could even find small or big producer, But these would only work by chance of luck when finding the music you want.</p>
              </fieldset>
              </li>
              <li>
              <fieldset class="method">
                <legend class="method-heading">Playlist</legend>
                <p>Playlist, a unique way to find music and probably on of the most use method in which there is many place you could find and get recommended one, such as Youtube, spotify, or Discover weekly.</p>
              </fieldset>
              </li>
               </li>
              <li>
              <fieldset class="method">
                <legend class="method-heading">music/streaming service</legend>
                <p>These are the many method mention earlier but touching on this topic you could also find these on places that specifically contain music such as spotify, Itune,Disover weekly, or release Radar.</p>
              </fieldset>
              </li>
               </li>
              <li>
              <fieldset class="method">
                <legend class="method-heading">Music community</legend>
                <p>You could join commmunity that like to talk about music like r/music on reddit or noon pacific website, in which it be people mainly talking about music they are interest in or new music which than you could possibly find a music you like in the music they either recommend or talk about in the community.
              </fieldset>
              </li>
               </li>
              <li>
              <fieldset class="method">
                <legend class="method-heading">Live show/concert</legend>
                <p>This method is costly but you could always join a random or famous one to see if you like the artist music as you could even become interested in going to one and they play their own music kind of like a playlist sometime allowing you to be there in person.
              </fieldset>
              </li>

            <header class="headings">What if I still can't find a song?</header>
            <p class="describe">If you were not able to find one even after all the method that is recommended than my best option for you to look back at what is a music you liked and try harder or just wait because finding music could also come by chance or maybe some day a music you like would be made since those method should have help you unless you dont try or just couldn't search for it due to other reason, but i recommend wait or try again.</p>
